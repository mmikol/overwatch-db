"""Matching counterpick.gg's hero and map names against the ones we loaded.

The authoritative tier loads names as Blizzard and the wiki write them -
"Lucio", "D.Va", "Soldier: 76", "King's Row". A third site writes the same
names its own way, and the differences are all punctuation and accents:
"Lucio" against "Lucio", "DVa" against "D.Va", "soldier-76" against
"Soldier: 76".

Lowercasing alone does not close that gap, and a name that fails to match is
not a loud failure - it is a row silently dropped, which is the worst kind. So
matching folds the name down to its letters and digits and compares those.

Scoped to heroes and maps, where the fold cannot collide: no two heroes differ
only by punctuation.
