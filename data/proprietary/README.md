# proprietary — the strategy layer

**Partially implemented: the authored playbook is real.** Three committed
CSVs load into the playbook — `synergies.csv`, `archetypes.csv` (the role
shape each style's comp wants) and `map_playstyle.csv` (what kind of fight
each map rewards) — see "The authored pipelines" below. The inference layer
is built too — see "Asking for a comp".

## What this type of data is for

The other two types answer *what is true* about the game:

| type | claim | example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/authoritative` | what a source measured | Ana's biotic grenade has a 10s cooldown; Widowmaker wins 49.5% on Busan |
| `data/heuristic` | what a source judges | Winston is a dive hero; Zarya is countered by Sombra |

This type answers *what we should do about it* — and, unlike the other two, its
input is **ours**, not scraped. A user writes strategies in whatever form suits
them: a paragraph of prose, a list of rules, a note about a team's tendencies, a
scribbled preference for brawl over poke. There is no schema to fill in.

A model then reads that alongside everything in the database — the roster and
its abilities, the map pool, the rates, the playbook of counters and best maps
— and infers a team composition.

```
COUNTER = MAX[ HEROES ∩ MAPS ∩ META ]
```

The other types supply the three sets. This one supplies the objective
function: which maximum, for whom, under what constraints.

## Why it is a separate type

Because its data cannot be re-scraped. Drop the database and rerun the
pipeline, and everything in the authoritative and heuristic types comes back
byte for byte. Anything written here does not — it exists only because someone
wrote it. That difference in provenance is the whole reason for the separation:
these are the rows that need backing up, and the ones a rebuild must never
silently discard.

It is also the only type whose output is an *opinion the database produced*,
rather than an opinion it recorded. A heuristic row says "counterpick.gg thinks
Sombra beats Zarya". A proprietary row would say "given your strategy notes and
this map, play Sombra". Those want to be told apart when reading results back.

## The authored pipelines (built)

`synergies.csv` holds one ordered claim per row — `hero,other,score,note` —
and is committed, because it cannot be re-scraped. Synergy is bidirectional - a pair is written once,
in either order, and stored once (counters, by contrast, are arrows). The
loader treats the file as the whole truth (the table mirrors it exactly),
refuses unknown hero names and duplicated pairs loudly instead of dropping
rows, and records everything under the `user` source. The `note` column is not decoration: the reasoning is what a strategy
model will actually condition on.

`seasons.csv` (`name,started,note`) is the coarse delineator of meta
snapshots - authored because the wiki's season pages are undated lore. Loading
it recomputes `season_id` on every existing snapshot, so a season added later
corrects history. The current era's chapters ("Reign of Talon") have no
published dates yet; add them here the day they do.

`archetypes.csv` (`style,role,slots,note`) defines what a composition IS - the
role shape each playstyle wants, with the note naming who typically fills the
slot. `map_playstyle.csv` (`map,style,score,note`) says what kind of fight
each map rewards, on the same 1-3 scale. All three follow the same contract:
committed, whole-truth on reload, loud errors on unknown names.

## Asking for a comp (built)

```bash
python -m data.proprietary.recommend --map "King's Row" \
    --enemy Zarya --enemy Mei --ask "we keep losing the first fight"
```

`dossier.py` (deterministic, model-free, tested) assembles numbered evidence
lines — E1, E2, ... — from the whole database: what the map rewards, who
answers each enemy, the archetype slot shapes, every authored synergy, ban
pressure. `recommend.py` shows that dossier to Claude (`claude-opus-5`;
override with `--model` or `OVERWATCH_DB_MODEL`) beside the strategy notes
from `strategies/*.md`, and requires a schema-valid answer in which every
pick cites the tags that justify it. Citations of evidence never shown, and
heroes that do not exist, are errors — not stored rows.

Every exchange lands twice: in the INFERENCE tables (`recommendations`,
`recommendation_picks`, `recommendation_evidence` — queryable, wiped by
rebuild like any session state) and as a markdown transcript in
`recommendations/` (committed, durable). Credentials resolve as the SDK
always does: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, or an
`ant auth login` profile.

The three needs sketched here originally all now exist: free-form strategy
input (`strategies/*.md` → the strategies table), the full
asked/shown/answered record (`recommendations.prompt` / `.response`), and
per-pick links back to justifying rows (`recommendation_evidence`). What
remains judgement is the dossier's selectivity — which slices of the
database are worth showing — and that is tuned in `dossier.py`, in the open.

## What has to be true first

A recommendation is only as good as the granularity underneath it. See
[docs/scaling.md](../../docs/scaling.md): today the meta is Americas, one
platform, all ranks combined, and whole maps rather than map stages. A team
composition for a specific stage, at a specific rank, on a specific platform is
not answerable from the current data — not because the model could not reason
about it, but because the numbers underneath are not sliced that finely yet.
