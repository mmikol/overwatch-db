-- INFERENCE: what the model was asked, what it was shown, what it answered.

-- The proprietary layer's output side. A recommendation here is an opinion
-- the database PRODUCED, not one it recorded - so every row must be
-- explainable: the strategies it read, the evidence lines it was shown, and
-- which of them justified each pick, all kept alongside the answer.
--
-- These tables are a session log. `rebuild` drops them like everything else;
-- the durable record is the transcript each recommendation also writes into
-- data/proprietary/recommendations/, which is committed and survives.
--
-- Depends on heroes (002), maps (003) and the playbook (005).
